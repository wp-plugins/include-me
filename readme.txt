Include Me helps to include any external file (textual, HTML or PHP) in posts or pages.

== Description ==

Include Me helps to include in posts or pages external files usually to be shared
between different posts or pages or that contains PHP or other code that can be
compromised by the visual editor.

The best way to use it is to include functionalities
written in external PHP that will be rendered in post body or to include pieces of
javascript that will be hard to add with WordPress editor.

An example can be the code supplied by chat services or widgets to be shown in a
full page (not in a side bar) like the ones of Facebook or MyBlogLog.

Inclusions can be rendered with IFRAME if needed to create boxes that display
external web pages.
